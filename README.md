# MicroDropBots

This mod adds [Defensive Microbots][] as a regular item that can be found in the game world. With this mod, the item can be found in chests and the last Cell Vent, purchased from cauldrons, and selected with Artifact of Command. Captain will continue to spawn with it by default.

**Network compatibility:** In multiplayer, only the host needs the mod.

### Patch notes

v1.0.1

* No changes. Something went wrong when uploading v1.0.0 and the mod cannot be found in the mod manager; maybe a republish will help.

v1.0.0

* Initial version.
